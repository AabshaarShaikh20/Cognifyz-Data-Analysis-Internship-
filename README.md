## Project Overview

This project delves into a restaurant dataset to extract insights, perform data visualizations, and apply statistical analyses. Each level involves more complex tasks, such as analyzing reviews, votes, and services like online delivery and table booking based on price ranges.

---

## Dataset Information

The dataset includes details such as:
- Restaurant names
- Ratings and votes
- Cuisines offered
- Latitude and longitude coordinates for geographic analysis
- Price range
- Availability of services like online delivery and table booking

---

## Level 1 - Basic Analysis

**Task 1: Top Cuisines**
- Identified the top three most common cuisines.
- Calculated the percentage of restaurants serving each of the top cuisines.

**Task 2: City Analysis**
- Determined the city with the highest number of restaurants.
- Calculated the average rating for restaurants in each city.

**Task 3: Price Range Distribution**
- Visualized the distribution of price ranges using bar charts or histograms.
- Calculated the percentage of restaurants in each price range.

**Task 4: Online Delivery**
- Calculated the percentage of restaurants that offer online delivery.
- Compared the average ratings of restaurants with and without online delivery.

## Level 2 - Intermediate Analysis

**Task 1: Restaurant Ratings**
- Analyzed the distribution of aggregate ratings.
- Determined the most common rating range.
- Calculated the average number of votes received by restaurants.
- Identified the city with the highest average rating.

**Task 2: Cuisine Combination**
- Identified the most common combinations of cuisines.
- Analyzed if certain cuisine combinations tend to have higher ratings.

**Task 3: Geographic Analysis**
- Plotted restaurant locations using longitude and latitude.
- Identified geographic clusters of restaurants.

**Task 4: Restaurant Chains**
- Identified restaurant chains present in the dataset.
- Analyzed the ratings and popularity of different chains.

## Level 3 - Advanced Analysis

**Task 1: Restaurant Reviews**
- Analyzed text reviews to find the most common positive and negative keywords.
- Calculated the average review length and explored its relationship with ratings.

**Task 2: Votes Analysis**
- Identified restaurants with the highest and lowest number of votes.
- Analyzed the correlation between the number of votes and restaurant ratings.

**Task 3: Price Range vs. Services**
- Analyzed the relationship between price ranges and the availability of online delivery and table booking.
- Determined if higher-priced restaurants are more likely to offer these services using statistical analysis (Chi-Square test).

## Conclusion

- This analysis provides valuable insights into restaurant data, including the distribution of cuisines, votes, geographic clusters, and service availability. 
- Higher-priced restaurants were found to be more likely to offer services such as online delivery and table booking. 
- The project also delves into text reviews and correlations between votes and ratings.
